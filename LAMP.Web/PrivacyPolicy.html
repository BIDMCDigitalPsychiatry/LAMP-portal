                    <h5>YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION:</h5>
                    <p>“Your information” is the information we request when you initially download and launch the app. It is then accessible from your user profile under ‘Settings.’ This information includes, but is not limited to your user name and user profile you had used to register for the app. We also receive other types of information about you that is customarily gathered by web and mobile applications:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>We receive data about you whenever you interact with the LAMP app, such as when you launch the application, click on, view or otherwise interact with a feature. This may include date and time of the request, the feature requested, and completion status of the request.</li>
                        <li>We receive data from the mobile phone you use to launch LAMP app.</li>
                        <li>We receive data about your answers to surveys and cognitive tests.</li>
                        <li>If you opt in, we receive geospatial data that can tell us where you are nearby when you interact with the app.</li>
                        <li>If you opt in, we receive data about your step count and other information provided by Apple Health Kit or Google Fit.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h5>HOW WE USE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION:</h5>
                    <p>
                        Your personal information may be used to support internal operations, including troubleshooting/user support, and service improvements. To ensure you are receiving the highest level of service in your interaction with the LAMP app, your contact information may be used to communicate back with you regarding your requests. <br>
                        We also use the data to create aggregated statistics which helps us in the improvement of our service. Aggregated data allows us to evaluate "traffic" patterns to our app in terms of the number and role of visitors, level of demand, most popular requests, and types of errors. These statistics are not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person. This data may be kept for an indefinite amount of time, and it may also be used at any time and in any way reasonably necessary to monitor for security breaches and to ensure the integrity of the data on our servers.
                    </p>

                    <h5>INFORMATION WE SHARE WITH OTHERS:</h5>
                    <p>
                        We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties any information we receive. We may release information we collect to judicial, law enforcement or other government agencies when we believe release is appropriate to comply with a governmental or court order, or the law, to enforce our own policies, or to protect ours or others’ rights, property or safety. <br>
                        We may share aggregate statistics about our visitors, general traffic patterns, app usage, survey answers, cognitive test results, and phone collected data like step count, geospatial location, flights of steps climbed (and other Apple Healthkit and Google Fit data) for purely research purposes. If used for research, your data will be only used in an aggregate form. We will never use your data for marketing or commercial purposes.
                    </p>

                    <h5>HOW WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION:</h5>
                    <p>We make every reasonable effort to protect your information against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure or destruction using current security technologies. Servers that host the LAMP app and store your personal information are maintained in a secured facility behind a firewall. The LAMP app security measures are reviewed regularly and are consonant with policies for secure healthcare data storage. Finally, we restrict access to users’ personal information to our employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to process it on our behalf for purposes of providing you support and services. These individuals are required to attend training on patient privacy and confidentiality and are bound by strict confidentiality obligations.</p>

                    <h5>DELETING YOUR ACCOUNT</h5>
                    <p>Your account may be deleted via the app through the delete my account button. You may delete your account at any time. When you delete your account you will be asked if you want us to delete your data as well.</p>
